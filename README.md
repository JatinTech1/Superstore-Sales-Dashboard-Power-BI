# Superstore-Sales-Dashboard-Power-BI
## Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built on Superstore sales data to analyze business performance across different dimensions. The dashboard helps uncover insights into sales, profit, and orders with respect to region, segment, category, subcategory, shipping, and payment modes.
The dashboard enables stakeholders to track trends, compare year-over-year (YoY) growth, and make data-driven decisions for improving sales and operational efficiency.

## Dashboard Features

## 1.	KPIs Used
- Total Sales
- Total Profit
- Total Orders
- Average Ship Day

## 2.	Visuals Included
-	Sales by Region – Regional sales performance comparison.
-	Sales by Segment – Contribution of consumer, corporate, and home office segments.
-	Sales by Payment Mode – Distribution of sales across different payment methods.
-	Monthly Sales by YoY – Month-over-month trend with year-over-year growth.
-	Monthly Profit by YoY – Tracking profitability trends over time.
-	Sales by Ship Mode – Impact of shipping methods on sales.
-	Sales by Category & Subcategory – Identifying top-performing and underperforming product lines.

## 3.	Filters & Slicers
-	Region-based slicer for interactive analysis.
